I can successfully start mysqld by doing either of 2 things.

1) add 'innodb_force_recovery=4' to [mysqld] in my.cnf

or....

2) set 'innodb_change_buffering=none' in my.cnf 

Number 1 does number 2 on it's own as well as disables any innodb table stats. However, just adding 'innodb_stats_persistent=0' to my.cnf alone does *not* fix the problem, so the issues seems to be related to the innodb insert/change buffer. I have tried the exact same data and databases on the same exact EC2 instance using MySQL-server-5.6.10-1.el6.x86_64 as well as MySQL-server-5.6.13-1.el6.x86_64. The results are always the same.
